# Basic College Database Management

This project contains a SQL-based system for managing college data, including student information, faculty details, class scheduling, subject data, assignment records, and report card generation. It provides various SQL scripts and database components to facilitate college data management.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Ensure you have a MySQL database server set up.
   - Create a new database and execute the SQL scripts in the "BasicCollegeQueries.sql" file to create the necessary tables, triggers, views, and procedures.

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Update your database configuration in the SQL scripts as needed. Make sure to set the correct database name, username, and password.

3. **Running SQL Queries:**
   - You can execute SQL queries using the MySQL command-line interface or any MySQL client that you prefer.

## Features

- **Table Creation:** Create tables for student, faculty, semester and section, class, subject, assignment, marks, and report card.

- **Triggers:** Set up triggers to ensure that marks and assignment data are within valid ranges.

- **Views:** Create views to gather insights into the number of students, distinct cities students come from, class advisors, student sections, and more.

- **Procedures:** Implement procedures to check attendance, fees payment, and late assignment submissions.

## Usage

- Execute SQL queries from the "BasicCollegeQueries.sql" file to perform various operations on the college database.

## Queries and Views

The project includes a set of SQL queries and views to extract useful information from the database. These queries cover topics like student statistics, faculty details, assignment submissions, and more. You can find the details of these queries in the "BasicCollegeQueries.sql" file.
